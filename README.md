Color Marriage Program
This JavaScript program simulates a "marriage" of two colors using their hexadecimal representations. The user is prompted to enter two colors in hexadecimal notation, and the program generates a new color by randomly combining the two provided colors.

How to Run the Program
1-Make sure you have a JavaScript environment (e.g., a web browser or Node.js) to run the program.

2-Download or copy the contents of the color_marriage.js file.

3-Open your JavaScript environment (browser or Node.js).

4-Paste the contents of the color_marriage.js file into the JavaScript environment.

5-Execute the program.

Using the Program
The program will prompt you to enter two colors in hexadecimal notation. A color in hexadecimal notation is represented by 6 alphanumeric characters, combining the digits from 0 to 9 and the letters from A to F. For example: "FF0000" for red, "00FF00" for green, etc.

If you do not enter a valid color in hexadecimal notation, the program will ask you to try again until you provide two valid colors.

Once you have entered two valid colors, the program generates a new color by randomly combining the two provided colors.

The resulting color is displayed at the end of the program.

Example Execution
mathematica
Copy code
Enter the first color: FF0000
Enter the second color: 00FF00
The color marriage of FF0000 and 00FF00 is FFFF00
In this example, the user entered two valid colors ("FF0000" for red and "00FF00" for green). The program generated a new color ("FFFF00"), which is the combination of these two colors.
